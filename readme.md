## Introduction

Customised training program on Docker for sysadmins.
This program specialises in running Docker in clusterised mode (Swarm).
We will be using Docker Community Edition for this program.

---

## Preparing the physical/virtual machines

- CPU, Memory & Disk space
- System clocks
- Network (Inbound and outbound connections)
- Shared disk between the server nodes

Also the following prerequisites must be met:

- Linux Kernel 3.1+
- Host operating system (Installed on the servers): CentOS 7x
- Ansible IT Management/Automation tool installed your local computer (Read more: documentation/ansible.md)

You may configure time daemons with this Ansible playbook:

```bash

ansible-playbook -i playbooks/hosts -k -K -u root playbooks/install-configure-chrony.yml

```

---

## Installing Docker-CE

Follow the steps on this page: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/ 

Or install with Ansible:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i playbooks/hosts -k -K -u root playbooks/install-docker-ce.yml
```

## About Docker Swarm

### Feature highlights

+ Cluster management integrated with Docker Engine: Use the Docker Engine CLI to create a swarm of Docker Engines where you can deploy application services. You donâ€™t need additional orchestration software to create or manage a swarm.

+ Decentralized design: Instead of handling differentiation between node roles at deployment time, the Docker Engine handles any specialization at runtime. You can deploy both kinds of nodes, managers and workers, using the Docker Engine. This means you can build an entire swarm from a single disk image.

+ Declarative service model: Docker Engine uses a declarative approach to let you define the desired state of the various services in your application stack. For example, you might describe an application comprised of a web front end service with message queueing services and a database backend.

+ Scaling: For each service, you can declare the number of tasks you want to run. When you scale up or down, the swarm manager automatically adapts by adding or removing tasks to maintain the desired state.

+ Desired state reconciliation: The swarm manager node constantly monitors the cluster state and reconciles any differences between the actual state and your expressed desired state. For example, if you set up a service to run 10 replicas of a container, and a worker machine hosting two of those replicas crashes, the manager creates two new replicas to replace the replicas that crashed. The swarm manager assigns the new replicas to workers that are running and available.

+ Multi-host networking: You can specify an overlay network for your services. The swarm manager automatically assigns addresses to the containers on the overlay network when it initializes or updates the application.

+ Service discovery: Swarm manager nodes assign each service in the swarm a unique DNS name and load balances running containers. You can query every container running in the swarm through a DNS server embedded in the swarm.

+ Load balancing: You can expose the ports for services to an external load balancer. Internally, the swarm lets you specify how to distribute service containers between nodes.

+ Secure by default: Each node in the swarm enforces TLS mutual authentication and encryption to secure communications between itself and all other nodes. You have the option to use self-signed root certificates or certificates from a custom root CA.

+ Rolling updates: At rollout time you can apply service updates to nodes incrementally. The swarm manager lets you control the delay between service deployment to different sets of nodes. If anything goes wrong, you can roll-back a task to a previous version of the service.

## Configuring Docker Swarm

Decide which node will be the first manager and create the swarm. Then run this command on the first manager to do it:

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <ip|interface:port>
```

For example:
```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.0.0.6:2377
```

If the node cannot connect to swarm, check that the host is able to connect to the docker manager host. For example a firewall might be blocking the port.


---

## Important locations on the filesystem

- /var/lib/docker (default location for docker's metadata)
- /etc/docker/ (contains docker's 'daemon.json' config file)
- ~/.docker/config.json (per user auth config)
- /var/run/docker.sock (Docker's UNIX Socket for connections to Engine API)

---

## Docker Engine API


The daemon listens on unix:///var/run/docker.sock but you can Bind Docker to another host/port or a Unix socket.
The API tends to be REST. However, for some complex commands, like attach or pull, the HTTP connection is hijacked to transport stdout, stdin and stderr.
A Content-Length header should be present in POST requests to endpoints that expect a body.
To lock to a specific version of the API, you prefix the URL with the version of the API to use. For example, /v1.18/info. If no version is included in the URL, the maximum supported API version is used.
If the API version specified in the URL is not supported by the daemon, a HTTP 400 Bad Request error message is returned.

### Example connection to API with Netcat

```bash

Pasis-MacBook-Pro:~ pasi$ nc -U /var/run/docker.sock
GET /v1.37/images/json HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

## Healthchecks

Read docker healthchecks from: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/ 

For example:
```bash

HEALTHCHECK --interval=5m --timeout=3s \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1

```
